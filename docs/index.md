# Welcome to B.C. Government

The B.C. Developer Guide **(BCDG)** offers B.C. Government developers a living guide to application development within the public service. Please use it as a reference throughout the software lifecycle, and technical decisions.   

The Developer Experience Team updates the BCDG. We've embedded links into our content to facilitate learning. For any questions, concerns or feedback, we can be reached at developer.experience@gov.bc.ca.
