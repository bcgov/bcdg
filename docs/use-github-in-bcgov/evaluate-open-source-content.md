# Evaluate open-source content 

We've written guidelines to make sure teams can use current, open-source content on GitHub. The [Start working]() doc has more information on conditions for approval. 

The four concerns below speak to restrictions to posting material publicaly: 

* Privacy

* Security

* Copyright

* Legal, contractual, and policy requirements

## Privacy

Personal information **(PI)**, like name, phone number, photo, address, driver's license numbers, etc., must not be posted in public repos.

Teams may contact their privacy analyst for help in privacy assessments. 

## Security

Contact your Ministry Chief Information Security Officer **(MISO)** to make sure all mandatory security controls are implemented. Anything labelled **'Public** must meet the [Information Security Classification Framework](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/information-security/information-security-classification). 

## Copyright

The requirements below are mandatory: 

* Content is created only by B.C. government employees

* Content is owned by the B.C. government and doesn't have third-party content. Collect copies of contracts related to the content for review with the [Intellectual Property Program](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/intellectual-property/intellectual-property-program) **(IPP)**.

* Content doesn't have terms of use or exclusive licences that prohibit the Province from licensing the content on GitHub. Collect information about any terms of use or licences related to the content for review with the IPP.

* The team has authority to license the content. More information can be found on the [Li](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/license-your-github-repository/)

Ministries must contact the IPP to assist in this assessment. The Legal Services branch offers legal review or advice.

## Legal, contractual, and policy requirements

The public release and use of content must be permitted under law, contract, or policy. Any and all ramifications of the content must be addressed beforehand.
