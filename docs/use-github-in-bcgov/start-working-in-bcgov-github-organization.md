# First steps working in GitHub

Teams planning to share code need to evaluate the content, and get approval from their Deputy Minister **(DM)**. A DM may delegate approval to a Ministry Chief Information Officer **(MCIO)**.

The B.C. Government works in the open, using [open development practices](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/policies-standards/dcop/open/): 

* [Mandatory pages for GH repo](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/required-pages-for-github-repository/): README file, contributing file, Code of Conduct file, and license file.

* Roles and responsibilities

* Basic mechanics of working in GitHub

## Three common ways to start working in GitHub

### Post existing code or projects 

There are two common approaches a team can take: 

* **Throw it over the wall:** code that can be made availabe to others, but cannot make an open-ended committement to keep an active open-source project.

* **Create and run a sustainable project:** code that can be made available, then run as an active project, inclusive of accepting patches, soliciting code contributions, adding new maintainers, participating in user and developer forums, doing regular releases and more.

Both methods use similar ways to release the code. They differ in project management and resourcing. Key requirements in these scenarios include the following:

* Confirm team authority to license.

* Choose an open-source license, and consult with the Intellectual Property Program (IPP) to make sure government has the right to release the code.
    * If using code from another open-source project, adhere to the existing licensing provisions, and make sure the licences are compatiable. Per [evaluate open](), don't infringe on intellectual property rights. These can include, patent rights, trademarks in the code or documentation. 

* Confirm that there are no restrictions on releasing the code or documentation imposed by legislation, policy or contracts.

* Assess any dependencies

Check library dependencies, sample or configuration data to make sure it's appropriate for release, or is separated out, if needed.

Active project needs appropriate processes and terms to manage contributions.

### Integrating GitHub Apps

We get large volumes of asks about adding GitHub Apps to our org's repos. Request a GitHub App to be installed from the **BCDevOps Requests Issue: Request for integrating a GitHub App**. 

If the available applications don't work for the team please create an issue. We need:

* Contact information

* Detailed information about the GitHub App

### Initiate new code or projects

These projects fall under open-source and collaboration:

* Choose an open-source licence and confirm team authority to license

* Create the [mandatory pages for GH repo](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/required-pages-for-github-repository/):Create the mandatory required content.

## Contribute to external code or projects

Sometimes, it's useful and appropriate for employees to contribute to non-B.C. Government repos as part of their workflow. In these cases, consider the following:

* Any contribution, size, and scope is relevant. Team leads should confirm this. 

* Licensing provisions of the project must be appropriate. For example, it's licensed under an OSI approved license and no requirement to assign copyright to the project.

* If the project requires a contributor agreement to be signed, get advice from Legal Services if terms are appropriate.

* If the project uses a reciprocal or "copyleft" license, such as GPL or Mozilla, understand the requirements for publishing any modifications to the code. 

* Confirm team authority to license.

Employees can also contribute to non-B.C. government owned intellectual property rights outside their professional roles by using their personal email linked to their GitHub account.
