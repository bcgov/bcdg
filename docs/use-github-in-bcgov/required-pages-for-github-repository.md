# Mandatory GitHub repo files

The following markdown files are required in every `bcgov` repos:

* License file **(LICENSE.md)**
* README file **(README.md)**
* Code of Conduct file **(CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**
* Contributing guidelines file **(CONTRIBUTING.md)**

## License file 

All repos need a license. Choose the best fit for the team repo. Important information about license types can be found on the [Li](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/license-your-github-repository/) 

## README file

Please follow [GH README guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) and [5 tips for making your GitHub profile page accessible](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/5-tips-for-making-your-github-profile-page-accessible/) for guidance to create good README files. Teams can find extensive documentation on GH about README files for repos.

Aside from GH documentation, please include:

* A brief project description.

* An overview of how to contribute to the team repo, and a link to repo contribution guidelines.

* Dependent on licence, boilerplate text. [Li]() offers more information about the topic. 

* A link to team Code of Conduct file.

Here's a [sample README file](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/SAMPLE-README.md ).

## Code of Conduct file

Code of Conducts fosters an open and welcoming environment, if written with clarity. 

Two starting points for creating a strong Code of Coduct:
* [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/): common Code of Conduct for open source projects.

* [GitHub's guidelines on healthy contributions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors): guidance on setting up a code of conduct for healthy contributions.

Here's a [sample Code of Conduct file](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/SAMPLE-CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing guidelines file

Always make sure contribution guidelines offer clarity and accurate methods of contributing to team repos.

For example, if the repo needs contributors to fork the repo and submit pull requests, make sure it's included. Also, add links to the applicable documentation.

Contributors should be aware of the repo license and relevant documentation.
