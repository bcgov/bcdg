# Removing member access from `bcgov` and `bcgov-c`

Removing a member's access should only occur when members don't work for the government anymore or moved to a different role that doesn't need access.

We have two steps to remove access:
1. Remove their access to team repos. 

2. Remove membership in `bcgov` and/or `bcgov-c` orgs.

## Step 1: Remove access to team repos

A member access a team repo by GitHub team membership, or direct repo access. The GitHbub help pages below offers guidance on how to do removal: 

* [removing members from GitHub team(s)](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository#removing-access-for-a-team-or-person)
* [removing members from repo "Collaborators & teams" setting](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/removing-organization-members-from-a-team)

## Step 2: Remove membership in `bcgov` and/or `bcgov-c` orgs

The Developer Experience team facilitate membership in the `bcgov` and `bcgov-c` orgs. IDIRs control membership, so a team's manager must cancel a member's IDIR account. This makes sure users are removed, however, cancellation may take a few days. 

Please remove the member's access from team repos immediately.
