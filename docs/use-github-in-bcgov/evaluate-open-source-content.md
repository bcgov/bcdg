# Evaluate open-source content 

To prepare for open-source development, all teams must undergo an evaluation process of their content before posting anything onto `bcgov` or `bcgov-c` GitHub organizations.

We wrote guidelines below to help teams in four areas that can restrict open-source: 

* Privacy

* Security

* Copyright

* Legal, contractual, and policy requirements

The [First steps working in GitHub doc](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/start-working-in-bcgov-github-organization/) may also be of help because it has more information on conditions for approval. 

## Privacy

Personal information **(P.I.)**, like name, phone number, photo, address, driver's license numbers, etc., must not be posted in public repos. Teams should contact their privacy analyst for help in privacy assessments. 

## Security

Contact the Ministry Chief Information Security Officer **(MISO)** to make sure all mandatory security controls are implemented.

Anything labelled **'public'** must meet the [Information Security Classification Framework](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/information-security/information-security-classification). 

## Copyright

The requirements below are mandatory before posting on GitHub: 

* Content is created only by B.C. Government employees

* Content is owned by the B.C. Government and doesn't have third-party content. Collect copies of contracts related to the content for review with the [Intellectual Property Program](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/intellectual-property/intellectual-property-program) **(IPP)**.

* Content doesn't have terms of use or exclusive licences that prohibit the Province from licensing the content on GitHub. Collect information about any terms of use or licences related to the content for review with the IPP.

* The team has authority to license the content. More information can be found on the [Licenses for GitHub repos doc](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/license-your-github-repository/).

Ministries must contact the IPP to assist in this assessment. The Legal Services branch offers legal review or advice.

## Legal, contractual, and policy requirements

The public release and use of content must be permitted under law, contract, or policy. Any and all ramifications of the content must be addressed beforehand.
