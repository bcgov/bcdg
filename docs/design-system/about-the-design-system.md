# About the B.C. Design System

The B.C. Design System provides components and resources to help developers and designers build accessible user interfaces faster and more consistently.

The design system is currently in active development. It replaces the [legacy design system](#the-legacy-design-system), which is no longer supported and has been archived.

## How the design system works

The B.C. Design System comprises 4 core elements:

- [Design tokens](#design-tokens)
- [React component library](#component-library) (in development)
- [Documentation hub](https://gov.bc.ca/designsystem)
- Design library in Figma (in development)

The goal of the design system is to provide a common set of resources for both developers and designers, to help enable more efficient collaboration.

## Releases

### Design tokens

The B.C. Design System tokens library provides a straightforward way for developers and designers to access and implement the basic visual language of the B.C. government's digital look and feel. Tokens provide flexible, standardised options for basic design decisions like:

- Colour
- Typography
- Spacing
- Sizing

For developers, tokens are exposed as CSS and JavaScript variables. Support for other languages may be provided in the future. For designers, tokens are published as styles and variables in Figma.

To start using tokens:

- [Install the B.C. Design Tokens package via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/design-tokens?activeTab=readme)
- [Get the B.C. Design Tokens library via Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1326994583954765832)

### Component library

The component library will provide an inventory of reusable user interface components, including:

- Components in Figma
- Reference implementations in React

Support for other languages and frameworks is currently out-of-scope.

The component library is currently in active development.

A [developer preview of the React library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/design-system-react-components) is published on npm.

## Design system management

The B.C. Design System is maintained by Government Digital Experience (GDX), a division of the Ministry of Citizens' Services. You can contact the design system team at [designsystem@gov.bc.ca](mailto:designsystem@gov.bc.ca) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system).

## Contribute to the design system

The design system is an open-source project. Its source code is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## The legacy design system

The previous B.C. government design system is not actively supported. Legacy documentation and components are available on [Classic DevHub](https://classic.developer.gov.bc.ca/About-the-Design-System) for reference.
