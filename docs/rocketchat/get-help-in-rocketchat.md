# Developing better questions

The best support on Rocket.Chat comes when users ask detailed questions. They help the community respond quicker. Here's an example of what a clear and detailed user question:

> I've set up a new caddy web server on OpenShift. I've created a Route for it. But when I go to the URL in my web browser I get an error page with "Application is not available". I confirmed the URL in the browser matches the route. I've tried with different browsers. I've checked the web server logs and the server is running with no errors. Here is my Route:


> **route.yml YAML**

    kind: Route
    apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
    metadata:
     name: my-web-server
     namespace: abcd12-dev
     labels:
      app: my-web-server
      group: my-project
    spec:
     host: my-web-server-abcd12-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca
     to:
      kind: service
      name: my-web-server
      weight: 100
     port:
      targetPort: web
     tls:
      termination: edge
      insecureEdgeTerminalPolicy: Redirect
     wildcardPolicy: None

The user includes the where, when, what, and how of an issue. The community wants to know what they expected, what happened, and in what environment the problem happened. Before connecting with other users, check Jon Skeet's [Stack overflow question checklist](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2012/11/24/stack-overflow-question-checklist/) if you've done everything possible before posting.

There's more guidance to strengthen a question below. Better questions make it easier to respond quicker.

## The 'how' and 'what'

### How

Please clearly define the problem, what was expected when doing a task, and the importance of it.

If it’s a sensitive task, please specify confidentiality is necessary. Being forthcoming about confidentiality stops us from expecting more information.  

**Please don’t include** sensitive artifacts, like passwords, tokens, API keys, etc.

### What

1. Define the problem's nature, what it looks like and how it’s behaving. For example, if a screen doesn’t load as expected, give a description of what it looks like, and what it should look like. Add a screenshot but while helpful, screenshots aren't accessible without alt text.  

2. After detailing the problem, the community wants to know what troubleshooting you tried. Being proactive helps narrow down solutions and stops repetition

    Please give a link to the source if you followed steps on a StackOverflow thread or read documentation about the problem

3. Last, please say what type of help you’re looking for. Are you looking for a solution, link to resources, and/or another way to complete a task? Please be very clear so the question isn't misinterpreted.
   
## The 'where'

Describe the environment the problem happened in: 

- In a cluster, give the namespace and cluster name (Silver, Gold, Gold DR, Emerald, KLab, CLab)
- With a stack or application code, what languages and libraries you used, including which versions
- With a tool, please specify which platform tool
- With a web application or UI, please specify which browser, browser version, and device
     - Are you using a Mac, a Windows machine, an iPhone, an Android, or another device?
- If with a service by another team, give the service name and if possible, related URLs and environment (DEV, TEST, PROD)

## The 'when'

 Timestamps help! Please consider letting the community know:
 
- The date
- The time, including time zone if different from P.S.T. 
- If working on a legacy task, the timestamp of the original work


## Post the question

When you finish writing the detailed question, please revisit [Stack overflow question checklist](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2012/11/24/stack-overflow-question-checklist/) to make sure you're being efficient. Then, post it in the [best Rocket.Chat channel](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/) for a quicker response.
