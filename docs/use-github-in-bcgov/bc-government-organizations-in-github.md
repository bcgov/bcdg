# B.C. Government organizations in GitHub

The [Digital Principles for B.C. Government](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/policies-for-government/core-policy/policies/im-it-management#12.1.1.5) urge product teams to work in the open. GitHub is the leading platform for open-source projects. It lets our organization work with the open-source community to build software, support innovation and save time and money. 

Using GitHub, teams can:

* Collaborate with the open-source community
* Share and control code versions
* Use tools for team and project management
* Integrate automation tools
* Track issues

B.C. Government's main organization is [bcgov](https://github.com/bcgov), where we store open code developed by government teams. It includes projects that have open-source and inner-source contribution models. `bcgov` has over 1000 repositories. 

We also have the `bcgov-c` organization, where developers can store confidential code.

On behalf of the B.C. Government, the Developer Experience Team manages government GitHub environments. For any questions or concerns, please [submit a support request]( https://citz-do.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2).

## Organizations in GitHub

!!! Note

    In July 2024, we enabled [Single Sign-On (SSO)](#single-sign-on) for `bcgov` and in August 2024, `bcgov-c`. To keep access to repositories in the `bcgov` and `bcgov-c` organizations, all users must be authenticated with IDIRs. Contractors and employees without IDIRs must order one before SSO can be enabled. 

We use GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and it hosts the `bcgov` and `bcgov-c` GitHub organizations:

```

### `bcgov`

The `bcgov` organization contains public repositories that hold open-source code or public documents developed by B.C. government teams. This organization is **public**.  To align with our Digital Principles, repositories should be hosted in this open repo. The only exception is strong rationale from your Ministry Security Information Officer.

* Any member of the `bcgov` organization can create repositories.

* To join this organization, follow [these instructions](#directions-to-sign-up-and-link-your-account-for-bcgov).

### `bcgov-c`

The `bcgov-c` organization stores private repositories with confidential source code and documents. This repository is **private**.

* Use this repository if you need a location for private code, or if you're working towards making the code public.
* Only the Developer Experience team can create repositories in this organization.
    * Request a repository by [submitting a request](https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-requests/issues/new?assignees=MonicaG%2C+oomIRL&labels=github-repo%2C+pending&projects=&template=github_repo_request.md&title=).
* To join this organization, follow [these instructions](#directions-to-sign-up-and-link-your-account-for-bcgov-c).


## Single Sign-On 

!!! Warning
    Contractors without an IDIR must follow the steps in the [our guide](github-transition-guide.md#idirs) before proceeding. **Please note** this can take several days to complete depending on your ministry. We recommend doing with this step as soon as possible to avoid access disruptions.  

Learn more about IDIRs and post-authentication steps in [our guide](github-transition-guide.md).

## Security Insights for GitHub Enterprise-linked organizations

The Security Insight feature is available for all organizations linked to the corporate GitHub Enterprise accounts, as well as branch protection and code owners for private repositories. Branch protection only allows specific people to push to the protected branch. The code owners feature allows automated reviews. For example, if a specific user is a code owner of certain files they are automatically added as PR reviewers and their approval is required before the code can be merged.
