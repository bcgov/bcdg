# Removing member access from `bcgov` and `bcgov-c`

Removing a member's access should only occur when members don't work for the government anymore or moved to a different role that doesn't need access.

We have two steps to remove access:
1. [Remove their access to team repos](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/removing-organization-members-from-a-team). 

2. [Remove membership in `bcgov` and/or `bcgov-c` orgs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository#removing-access-for-a-team-or-person).


## Step 1: Remove access to team repos

A GitHub user can access a team repo via GitHub team membership, or direct repo access. The GitHub help pages below offers guidance on how to complete removal: 

1. [removing members from GitHub team(s)](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/removing-organization-members-from-a-team)
2. [removing members from repo "Collaborators & teams" setting](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository#removing-access-for-a-team-or-person)

## Step 2: Remove membership in `bcgov` and/or `bcgov-c` orgs

The Developer Experience team doesn't remove membership from the `bcgov` and `bcgov-c` orgs. Membership is controlled by IDIRs, so a team's manager must [cancel a user's IDIR account on MyService Centre](https://ociomysc.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=5f3fab83db1a5690fa86193813961933). This makes sure users are removed, however, cancellation may take a few days. 

Please remove the member's access from team repos immediately.
