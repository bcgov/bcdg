# Welcome to the B.C. government

There are a plethora of things to consider when developing apps for [core government](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries). This list will hopefully get you started on the right foot. 

## Five quick things to get you started

1. Bookmark this site! It serves as the central hub for all development-related matters

2. Get [access to the BCGov GitHub organization](../use-github-in-bcgov/bc-government-organizations-in-github/#bcgov). This is the default place for code to be stored in the BC Gov. Learn more about [the different B.C. Government GitHub organizations](../use-github-in-bcgov/bc-government-organizations-in-github/#organizations-in-github). 

3. [Get access to Rocket.Chat](../rocketchat/steps-to-join-rocketchat) and BC Government [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.developer.gov.bc.ca/). These are where the developer community gathers to ask questions, support each other with issues and is often the best source of support for internal services such as our cloud services and common components.

4. [Explore the internal services](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/common-components/) and [Saas Tools](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/saas/) you can re-use to supports your work.

5. Learn about what's happening in the [BC Gov Digital Ecosystem](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/blog/)

Beyond this, most things are up to your team to decide, and not standardized. Browse the [documentation](/docs/) on this site to understand some of the existing resources available to you. Your team may have more guidance specific to your Ministry and team processes.
