# Remove a user's BCGov GitHub access

There are two steps to remove a user:

1. Remove their access to your repositories 
1. Remove their membership in the [bcgov](https://github.com/bcgov) and [bcgov-c](https://github.com/bcgov-c) GitHub organizations

## Remove access to repositories

A user may access your repositories by GitHub team membership or direct access.  

Remove their access by:

- [removing them from your GitHub team(s)](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/removing-organization-members-from-a-team) 
- [removing them in your repository's "Collaborators & teams" setting](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository#removing-access-for-a-team-or-person)


## Remove membership in GitHub organizations


!!! warning
    Only do this step if the user is no longer an employee or contractor with the government.

Membership in the [bcgov](https://github.com/bcgov) and [bcgov-c](https://github.com/bcgov-c) GitHub organizations is [controlled by IDIRs](github-transition-guide.md).

A team's manager must [cancel a user's IDIR account](https://ociomysc.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=5f3fab83db1a5690fa86193813961933) to remove them from the [bcgov](https://github.com/bcgov) and [bcgov-c](https://github.com/bcgov-c) GitHub organizations.

IDIR cancellation may take a few days to complete. So, make sure to remove the user's access to your repositories ASAP.
